# bigram-and-trigram-language-model-for-word-sequences

## Implementation and train a bigram and a trigram language model
## Probabilities  of correct VS incorrect unknown sentences based on the trained models
## Hyper-parameters tuning
## Estimate the language cross-entropy and perplexity of the models on the test set
## Interpolated bi-gram and tri-gram LM
